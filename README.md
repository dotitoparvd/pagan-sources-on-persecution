# Pagan Sources on Early Christian Persecution

A collaborative, version-controlled, and citable digital compendium of primary source excerpts from Roman-era pagan authors that mention or describe the persecution of Christians.

## Purpose

This project aims to provide a centralised resource for students and researchers interested in the historical accounts of Christian persecution as recorded by pagan authors. By collecting translated excerpts alongside historical commentary, we seek to illuminate the context, biases, and significance of these texts for the study of early Christianity and martyrdom.

## Scope

The compendium focuses on pagan sources from the first three centuries CE (approx. 1st–3rd centuries AD) that directly or indirectly reference the persecution of Christians. Included authors may include:

- **Tacitus** (*Annals*)
- **Suetonius** (*Lives of the Caesars*)
- **Pliny the Younger** (*Letters*)
- **Lucian of Samosata**
- **Celsus** (fragments)
- **Marcus Aurelius** (*Meditations*)
- **Other relevant pagan writers**

Each entry provides the original text (in a widely accepted English translation), a brief historical commentary, and bibliographical references.

## Methodology

1. **Source Selection**: Entries are chosen based on scholarly consensus regarding their relevance to the theme of persecution.
2. **Translation**: We use out‑of‑copyright or freely licensed translations (e.g., Loeb Classical Library, Perseus Digital Library) with proper attribution.
3. **Commentary**: Each commentary (200–300 words) addresses:
   - Historical context of the passage
   - The author’s perspective and potential biases
   - The passage’s significance for understanding the persecution of Christians
   - Connections to other sources or events
4. **Version Control**: The compendium is maintained on GitHub, allowing collaborative editing, transparent revision history, and stable releases (tags) that can be cited in academic work.
