**Author:** Tacitus  
**Work:** *Annals* 15.44

## Passage (English Translation)

**Translation** (adapted from the Loeb Classical Library, 1931):

> “Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man’s cruelty, that they were being destroyed.”

## Historical Commentary

Tacitus’s account of the Neronian persecution (AD 64) is the most detailed pagan testimony we possess for the early imperial attitude toward Christians. Writing about five decades after the event (*Annals* were composed ca. AD 115–120), Tacitus reflects the perspective of a Roman senator deeply embedded in the traditional aristocratic values of the *mos maiorum*. His description of Christians as “hated for their abominations” (*per flagitia invisos*) and adherents of a “most mischievous superstition” (*exitiabilis superstitio*) reveals the typical elite disdain for a foreign cult that appeared to reject Roman religious and social norms.

The passage is crucial for several reasons. First, it confirms that Nero deliberately scapegoated Christians to deflect suspicion that he himself had ordered the Great Fire of Rome. This political manoeuvre illustrates how a marginal religious group could be exploited for imperial propaganda. Second, Tacitus provides graphic details of the executions—the use of beast‑skins, crucifixion, and burning as “nightly illumination”—that align with Roman penal practices for low‑status offenders and with the rhetoric of spectacular punishment meant to deter others.

Despite his evident contempt for the Christian “superstition,” Tacitus subtly criticizes Nero’s excess. The final remark that the spectacle aroused pity because it served “not the public good, but to glut one man’s cruelty” distances the historian from the emperor’s personal savagery. This nuance allows us to see the episode as both a persecution of Christians and a indictment of tyrannical rule. The account thus serves not only as a source for the history of martyrdom but also as a window into the complex interplay of religion, politics, and public spectacle in early imperial Rome.
