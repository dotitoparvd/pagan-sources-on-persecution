# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the *Pagan Sources on Early Christian Persecution* compendium. To ensure consistency and scholarly quality, please follow the format and workflow described below.

## File Structure

Each source entry should be a separate Markdown file placed in the [`sources/`](sources/) directory. The file name should follow the pattern:

```
author-title-passage.md
```

For example:
- `tacitus-annals-15-44.md`
- `suetonius-nero-16.md`
- `pliny-letters-10-96.md`

## Required Sections

Every source file must contain the following sections, in order:

### 1. Author and Work

Provide the full name of the author and the title of the work (including book and chapter numbers if applicable).

Example:
```
**Author:** Tacitus  
**Work:** *Annals* 15.44
```

### 2. Passage (English Translation)

Include the relevant passage in English. Use a widely accepted, out‑of‑copyright or freely licensed translation (e.g., from the Loeb Classical Library, Perseus Digital Library, or a similarly reputable source). Provide a citation for the translation used.

Example:
```
**Translation** (adapted from the Loeb Classical Library, 1931):

> "Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinement of cruelty, a class of men loathed for their vices, whom the crowd called Christians. …"
```

### 3. Historical Commentary

Write a brief analysis (200–300 words) that covers:

- **Historical context:** When and why was the text written? What events does it describe?
- **Author’s perspective and biases:** What might have influenced the author’s portrayal of Christians? Are there political, social, or literary motives at play?
- **Significance for the study of persecution:** How does this passage contribute to our understanding of early Christian martyrdom? Does it corroborate or conflict with other sources?
- **Scholarly notes:** Any relevant historiographical debates, source‑critical issues, or connections to other works.

### 4. References

List the bibliographical details of the translation used and any secondary literature cited in the commentary. Use a consistent citation style (Chicago, MLA, or APA).

Example:
```
**References**

- Tacitus. *Annals*. Translated by John Jackson. Loeb Classical Library 322. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1931.
- Barnes, Timothy D. “Legislation against the Christians.” *Journal of Roman Studies* 58 (1968): 32–50.
```

## Workflow

1. **Check for existing issues**  
   Before starting, look at the [Issues](https://github.com/dotitoparvd/pagan-sources-on-persecution/issues) to see if the source you wish to add is already being worked on. If not, you may open a new issue describing the source and its relevance.

2. **Create a branch**  
   Fork the repository (if you are an external contributor) or create a new branch directly in the main repository with a descriptive name (e.g., `add/tacitus-annals-15-44`).

3. **Create the source file**  
   In your branch, create the Markdown file in the `sources/` directory, following the format above.

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   Submit a PR from your branch to the `main` branch. In the PR description, reference the issue it closes (e.g., “Closes #1”). Explain any scholarly choices you made (e.g., choice of translation, interpretation of the passage).

5. **Review**  
   A project maintainer will review the PR, possibly suggesting revisions. Once approved, the PR will be merged using a “squash and merge” to keep the commit history clean.

## Quality Assurance

- Ensure translations are accurate and properly attributed.
- Keep commentary concise and focused on historical analysis rather than theological evaluation.
- Avoid plagiarism; always credit the ideas and words of others.
- Use neutral, academic language.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about the format or the content, please open a discussion in the relevant issue or contact the project maintainers.
